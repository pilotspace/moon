# Phase 5 — Build (AI writes the code)

Goal: implement the feature so EVERY failing test passes — without changing any
test or the contract. This is the only phase the AI leads. It works because §1–§4
removed all ambiguity. Write code into `.add/tasks/<slug>/src/`.

## Work in small batches

Pick ONE task-sized slice, restate the tests it must satisfy, implement, run
tests, iterate to green. Keep each batch small enough to review in full — you
cannot move faster than you can verify.

## The cardinal rule

**Never weaken or delete a test to make it pass, and never edit the frozen
contract.** That makes the code judge itself. A genuine need to change either is a
change request back to Specify. Honor the feature-specific safety rule named in §5
(e.g. atomic balance update) — the one property tests alone may not force.

## AI prompt

<prompt>
Role: implement the feature so EVERY failing test passes — the build phase.
Read first: §1 · §3 · §4 · CONVENTIONS.
Objective: every §4 test green, one small batch at a time.
Steps:
  1. Make EVERY failing test pass, one small batch at a time, honoring the §5 safety rule.
  2. Report which tests pass and exactly what changed.
Never: change a test or the contract; use a package off the allow-list; or push past something unclear instead of asking.
</prompt>

## Exit gate

<exit_gate>
- [ ] All tests pass.
- [ ] Coverage did not decrease.
- [ ] No test and no contract modified by the AI.
- [ ] No dependency outside the allow-list.
- [ ] Change small enough to review in full.
</exit_gate>
