> **Purpose:** release the verified change, watch how it behaves in reality, and turn what you learn into the next specification.

## The flow is a loop, not a line

Older mental models end at "ship." That framing is the source of a common pathology: teams treat release as a finish line, and so they hide defects to protect the line rather than manage them in the open. In AIDD, release is not the end of the flow — it is the point where the most reliable information about the feature finally becomes available: how it behaves with real users, real data, and real load.

That information is the input to the next cycle. What you learn in production becomes the next specification, and the flow returns to [Step 1](./03-step-1-specify.md). The cycle is continuous.

## Release deliberately

Release behind a mechanism that limits the scope of impact of a mistake — a feature flag, a gradual rollout, or both. The verification step established that the feature is correct against everything you anticipated; a controlled release is your protection against what you did not anticipate. If something is wrong, you want to affect a few users and roll back, not affect everyone and scramble.

## Reuse the scenarios as monitors

The scenarios from [Step 2](./04-step-2-scenarios.md) have a second life here. They described the behavior you expected; in production they become the behavior you monitor. The same definition of "correct" that drove the tests now drives the alerts.

**What to watch (▶ example):**

- the overall transfer error rate;
- the rate of each individual rejection (`amount_invalid`, `same_account`, `insufficient_funds`, `forbidden`) — a sudden spike in one is a signal, not noise;
- latency, especially of the atomic balance update under load.

## Turn observation into the next spec

Every defect, surprise, or new need is written up as a change to the specification — a delta that re-enters the flow at [Step 1](./03-step-1-specify.md). An error rate that is too high, a rejection that fires more than expected, a user behavior nobody designed for: each becomes a concrete, specified next step rather than a vague intention.

This is also where the AI returns to a useful role: summarizing telemetry, clustering errors into themes, and drafting the proposed spec delta for a person to review. But the production decisions — what to roll back, what to prioritize — remain human.

## Lessons learned and the retrospective consolidation

A spec delta feeds the *next feature*. But a loop also teaches the **method itself** — that the domain model missed a boundary, that a whole class of scenario was never tested, that a build convention helped or hurt. AIDD captures those as **lessons learned**: a single tagged learning, written in the Observe step, marking which of the five competencies it sharpens.

| tag | competency | a delta here means you learned something about… |
|-----|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `DDD` | Domain | the domain model — an entity, rule, or boundary the spec assumed wrong |
| `SDD` | Spec | what the feature must do or reject — a missing or wrong requirement |
| `UDD` | UI/UX | the user-facing shape — a flow, affordance, or wording that misled |
| `TDD` | Test | how we prove correctness — a missing scenario, a flaky or hollow test |
| `ADD` | AI/build | how the AI builds — a harness, prompt, or convention that helped or hurt |

Each delta is one tagged entry — `- [COMPETENCY · status] the learning (evidence: a pointer)` — and the evidence is **required**: a failing scenario, a production signal, a review note. No evidence means it is an opinion, not a delta. The AI **emits** deltas as `open`; it never consolidates its own. Consolidation is judgment, and judgment is the human's — the same verify/observe decision point that keeps the AI from grading its own work.

**The consolidation.** At milestone close (or on demand, when open deltas pile up), a person runs the retrospective consolidation: **gather** every `open` delta across the milestone's tasks, **group** them by competency, **propose** the exact foundation edit for each, **confirm** with the human one by one, then **write** — append-only — flipping each delta to `folded` (merged) or `rejected` (considered and deliberately not merged, left in place so the trail survives), and bumping the `foundation-version:` marker. `DDD`/`SDD`/`UDD` deltas consolidate into the matching section of `PROJECT.md`; `TDD`/`ADD` consolidate into `CONVENTIONS.md` (they sharpen the engine, not the product); and **every** consolidation also appends one row to `PROJECT.md` §Key Decisions — the universal, auditable record of what the foundation learned.

**Tooling.** `add.py deltas` lists every open delta across the project (so nothing waiting to be consolidated is invisible); `add.py check` lints each delta's well-formedness — known competency tag, valid status, non-empty evidence. There is deliberately **no `add.py fold`**: the engine stays judgment-free, and the ritual lives with the human who owns it.

## Re-entrancy: the loop is the whole point

Two principles converge here. *The flow is re-entrant* — any step can send you back to an earlier one — and *the flow is a loop* — production feeds the next specification. Together they mean the artifacts you built are never "finished"; they are living documents that the next cycle refines.

A team operating this way does not experience requirements changing as a failure of planning. It experiences it as the system working: reality is teaching the specification, and the specification is teaching the next build.

## The milestone holds until its goal is met

A single feature loops through Observe back to Specify; a **milestone** has the same shape at a larger scale, and a gate to match. A milestone is not finished when its tasks are done — it is finished when its **goal** is met, expressed as the exit criteria in `MILESTONE.md`. So `add.py milestone-done` is **goal-gated**: it refuses to close a milestone while any exit criterion is still unchecked, and **holds until** every box is checked. Those checkboxes are the human's affirmation that the goal is genuinely met — the engine reads the tally, it never judges the goal itself. (A milestone with no exit criteria closes as before; `milestone-done` is the only path to `done`, and archiving refuses anything not yet done — so the one gate cannot be slipped.)

While the milestone is held open, the work each task leaves behind — open lessons, and items discovered but out of scope — becomes its next tasks: the AI proposes them, the human confirms, and the loop continues until the goal is reached. The milestone is the loop made concrete; the exit criteria are its finish line.

> **Do:** release small, watch the scenarios, and feed every learning back into the spec.
> **Don't:** treat shipping as the end. The most valuable information about a feature arrives *after* it ships.
