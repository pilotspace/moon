# AI-Driven Development

### A complete, practical book on building software when AI writes the code

**Edition:** 1.0 · **Type:** Methodology + operating manual

## What this book is

This is a complete guide to **AIDD (AI-Driven Development)** — a way of building software in which an AI agent writes most of the code and people do the two things AI cannot reliably do alone: decide *what* to build, and *verify* that what was built is correct.

It is written to be read once front to back, then kept open beside you as a working manual. The early chapters explain *why* the method has the shape it does; the middle chapters explain each step in detail; the later chapters explain how to operate it across a real team and product; the appendices are copy-paste reference material.

A single worked example — *transferring money between a user's own accounts* — runs through the entire book so that every abstract step has a concrete form you can see.

## Who it is for

Anyone who builds software with AI in the loop: engineers, architects, testers, designers, product owners, and the managers who lead them. No part assumes you have read the others; cross-references point you to what you need.

## The method in one paragraph

For every feature, before AI writes any code, you write four short artifacts in order — the rules it must obey, those rules as pass/fail scenarios, the data and interface contract, and the failing tests — and then you direct the AI to make the tests pass without changing them, and finally you verify the result through evidence rather than inspection. That ordered set of artifacts *is* the method. The code is disposable; the artifacts are the durable asset. Direction comes before speed, and trust comes from passing tests rather than from reading code and finding it plausible.

## The flow

> **Specify → Scenarios → Contract → Tests → Build → Verify → observe, then repeat.**

## Conventions used in this book

- **▶ Example** marks the running worked example.
- **Do / Don't** boxes give the rule in its shortest form.
- A **gate** is a checkpoint with an explicit pass/fail exit. Its outcome is always one of `PASS`, `RISK-ACCEPTED` (a signed waiver), or `HARD-STOP`.
- File names like `SPEC.md`, `features/*.feature`, `contracts/*` refer to the artifacts you create per feature; see [Appendix A](./appendix-a-templates.md).
- Where this book uses a plain step name, the formal phase name (for teams mapping to a larger standard) appears once in [Appendix C](./appendix-c-glossary.md).
