"""ADD — minimal scaffolder + state tracker for AI-Driven Development.

One file = one task. This tool generates the per-task TASK.md (which Claude fills
in step by step) and maintains .add/state.json so any fresh session can resume
with `add.py status` instead of re-reading the whole repo. That is the anti-
context-rot core of the ADD method.

Stdlib only. Writes are atomic (temp + os.replace) and refuse to clobber
existing artifacts unless --force is given.

# --- agent-agnostic update nudge --------------------------------------------
# ADD is agent-agnostic: ANY agent (Claude Code · Gemini CLI · Codex) is told by the
# guideline block to run `add.py status`/`guide` FIRST, every session. That is the one
# universal chokepoint to tell a stale install to refresh — a plain line on STDERR the
# agent reads and acts on. Bounded + fail-open by design (see _maybe_nudge_update).
#
# This is the engine's ONE deliberate, isolated network touch. It is justified narrowly:
# an agent that is offline cannot run at all, so when the network is unreachable this
# silently does nothing and nothing is lost. It NEVER changes a command's stdout or exit.
